# Training_Models

This repository contains implementations of machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for classification tasks. The models are trained and evaluated using standard datasets.

Features

Implementation of Decision Tree classifier.

Implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

Data preprocessing and feature engineering.

Model training, evaluation, and visualization.

Performance comparison between Decision Tree and SVM.

# Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies

# Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Training_Models.git
cd Training_Models


python train.py

The results, including model accuracy and visualizations, will be displayed in the output.

# Dependencies
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

You can install them using:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

# Results

After training, model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix will be displayed. Graphical representations of decision boundaries and feature importance may also be provided.
